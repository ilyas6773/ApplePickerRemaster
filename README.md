> Apple picker is a protype based on the idea of the classic game Kaboom! created in 1981 by Activision by Larry Kaplan. There have been many clones of Kaboom! over the years, and our version is the least violent of them all. In the original version, the player moves the containers left and right across the screen in an attempt to catch the bombs dropped by the Mad Bomber. In this version, the player will catch apples falling from a tree.
